# Summary
This game is a throwback to the little Tamagotchi games made popular in the 90s: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamagotchi. I made it for the Web Development Immersive at General Assembly, for practice with objects.

# Game Play
The game is very basic. Once you hit "start game" a timer begins and the tamagochi needs your help to survive! Users can feed the tamagotchi when it's hungry, put it to sleep when it's sleepy and give it medicine when it's sick. If any of it health points get too low, the tamagotchi dies :( Currently to run it you'll have to download the code onto your own computer.

# Unsolved Issues
Adding in the buttons I had to change the game so that you only interact with one of the tamagotchis, though I made two. Later versions would ideally allow you to choose one or play with both. Previous versions of the game also allowed the player to choose what food and medicine they were giving the tamagotchi. I'd also like to add an option for the player to input their own name, with a button that runs the "sayName" method. Most especially I'd love to fix the fact that all three death messages display when the tamagotchi dies.
